Address Overlap Error on RAMB18E1 : tb_Neander.dut.datapath.bram.U0.inst_blk_mem_gen.\gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen .\valid.cstr .\ramloop[0].ram.r .\prim_init.ram .\DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.SP.WIDE_PRIM18.ram .\gen_tdp.INT_RAMB_TDP  at simulation time 3027.160 ns.
A read/write/write was performed on address 1020 (hex) of port A while a write/read/write was requested to the overlapped address 1030 (hex) of port B with RDADDR_COLLISION_HWCONFIG set to PERFORMANCE and WRITE_MODE_A set READ_FIRST and WRITE_MODE_B set to READ_FIRST .  The write will be unsuccessful and the contents of the RAM at both address locations of port A and B became unknown.  To correct this issue, either evaluate changing RDADDR_COLLISION_HWCONFIG to DELAYED_WRITE, change both WITRE_MODEs to something other than READ_FIRST or control addressing to not incur address overlap.
